                          <h6 class="mb-4">  &nbsp; 1. Stick to a sleep schedule. </h6>
                          <p>Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. Sleeping later on weekends  won’t fully make up for a lack of sleep during the week and will make it harder to wake up early Monday morning. If you only implement one sleep change: make it this one.</p>

                          <div class="underline"></div>

                          <h6 class="mb-4"> &nbsp; 3. Avoid caffeine and nicotine </h6>
                          <p>Caffeine can take up to 8 hours to fully wear off. Nicotine is also a stimulant, often preventing smokers from sleeping deeply, and causing them to wake up early in the morning from nicotine withdrawal. <br> <br> <br> </p>

                          <div class="underline"></div>

                          <h6 class="mb-4">  &nbsp; 5. Avoid large meals & beverages late at night.  </h6>
                          <p>Lights snacks are fine, but large meals can cause indigestion, which affects your sleep. Drinking too much before may cause you to wake up to use the restroom, interfering with sleep cycles.</p>

                          <div class="underline"></div>

                          <h6 class="mb-4">  &nbsp; 7.  No naps after 3pm.   </h6>
                          <p>While naps can help make up for lost sleep, they can make it harder to fall asleep at night.</p>

                          <div class="underline"></div>

                          <h6 class="mb-4">  &nbsp; 9.  Take a hot bath before bed.   </h6>
                          <p>When you get out, your body temperature drops rapidly which makes you feel sleepy, and helps you relax. <br> <br> <br> </p>

                          <div class="underline"></div>

                          <h6 class="mb-4">  &nbsp; 11. Get morning sunlight exposure. </h6>
                          <p>Daylight keeps your sleep on the right schedule. Try to wake up with the sun, and to get 30 minutes of sunlight as early as you can. If you don't have access to natural light, turn on bright lights when you wake up. <br> <br> </p>

                        <h6 class="mb-4">  &nbsp; 2. Exercise, but not too late.  </h6>
                         <p>Try to exercise at least 30 minutes most days, but not sooner than 2–3 hours before bedtime. <br> <br> <br> </p>

                          <div class="underline"></div>

                         <h6 class="mb-4">  4. Avoid alcohol before bed.  </h6>
                          <p>A Nightcap may help you relax, but it robs you of REM (dream) sleep and prevents you from sleeping deeply. Binge drinking can also impair your breathing at night, causing you to interrupt your sleep cycles by waking up for short periods that you won’t remember. You also tend to wake up from withdrawal when the alcohol wears off.</p>

                          <div class="underline"></div>

                          <h6 class="mb-4"> &nbsp; 6. If possible, avoid medicines that delay or disrupt your sleep. </h6>
                          <p>Watch out for: heart, blood pressure, asthma medications, and over-the-counter cough, cold, or allergy medicine. If you think your medication is affecting your sleep, talk to your doctor.</p>

                          <div class="underline"></div>

                          <h6 class="mb-4"> &nbsp; 8. Relax before bed.  </h6>
                          <p>Don’t overschedule your day so you don’t have time to wind down. For example, try reading a book or listening to music as a part of your bedtime ritual.</p>

                          <div class="underline"></div>

                          <h6 class="mb-4"> &nbsp; 10.  Dark, cool gadget-free bedroom.  </h6>
                          <p>Remove anything distracting from your bedroom, e.g.: unpleasant noises, bright lights, an uncomfortable bed, or warm temperatures. Make sure you can’t see the time from where your sleeping, which can provoke anxiety. <br> <br> </p>

                          <div class="underline"></div>

                          <h6 class="mb-4"> &nbsp; 12.  Don’t lie in bed awake.  </h6>
                          <p>If you can’t sleep for more than 20 minutes, or if you’re starting to feel anxious or worried about sleeping, get up and do a relaxing activity until you feel tired. If you let yourself dwell on the anxiety of not being able to sleep, it makes it harder to actually fall asleep.</p>
