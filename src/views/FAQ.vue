                          <p>Sleep Coach is an interactive web app designed to help you get better sleep. With Sleep Coach, it's as simple as pressing a button on your computer when you get into bed, and then another button when you wake up in the morning, letting us know whether you feel rested. Then, log your previous day's activities, and we'll help you figure out what's affecting your sleep.</p>

                         <h6 class="mb-4"> <i class="mdi mdi-help-circle"></i> &nbsp; How much does Sleep Coach cost?  </h6>
                          <p> Sleep Coach is completely free.</p>

                          <h6 class="mb-4"> <i class="mdi mdi-help-circle"></i>&nbsp; Are you planning to add more features? </h6>
                          <p> Yes! We're working on a physical button that can be placed bedside, so you don't need to have your computer nearby when you go to sleep. We're also working on adding a number of charts to help you compare the habits that affect sleep to your sleep quality.</p>

                          <p> We think the new features will be here by the end of April, 2019. We'll update the FAQs here if implementation takes longer than expected.</p>
